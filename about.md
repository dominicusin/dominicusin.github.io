## Philosophy

> "I am not in search of trading my time for coins, but rather seeking a humble assembly where each soul is attuned to the collective pursuit, devoid of the need for guidance."

I believe in the power of open source software, decentralized systems, and the importance of preserving digital privacy and freedom.
