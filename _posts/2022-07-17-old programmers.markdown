The old programmers never die...

they gosub without return

they never even had life

they just decompile

they just cast to void

They just lose their memory.

They just byte it.

They just get bugged with life.

They just go to bits.

They just branch to a new address.

They just canâ€™t C as well


Old programming wizards never die, they just recurse.
Old C programmers never die. They are just cast into void\*
Old Java programmers never die. They are garbage collected.
Old programmers never die. They just terminate and stay resident.
